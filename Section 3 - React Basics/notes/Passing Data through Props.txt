We can pass data from one component to another component using props

we can not directly use the variables of one component inside of another

Props stands for properties

It is an object that returns the data as key-value pairs

example: 

props = {
    data: "Farzeen"
}

<component data = {'Farzeen'}/>

The attribute name in the compenent will be the key of the props object and the value passed in the attribute will be the value of the key inside the object
