React code is just JS code we are going to write some JS code

We will use some react features in react syntax but ultimatly it 
will be converted to JS code in the end


- React File Sturcture
Inside src folder there are bunch of JS files that we will look at

-- Index.js
This is the first file that will be executed when ever application starts

We will like code in easier developer friendly language but it will not run like
this in the browser, but what happens behind the scene is that there are some 
scripts that transfomer our written code and converted to browser friendly JS that browser can run

for example: in this index.js file we are importing a CSS file inside a JS
file, now this is an invalid syntax we can not import CSS files like this
so, here those built-in scripts come in to play that converts and optimized our
code in a browser freindly executable code. 

So here in react it will work, what we want to tell react is that "include the CSS file in to overall application"

- Public Directory

-- index.html
This is the only HTML file that react is using to render the application
because it is so called Single page applicatoin

So, all the user interactivity by the user will be handled by react.
It is this HTML file that react based user interface is rendered 

there is a div with the root class inside of which the page is rendered
<div class="root"></div>

Now, inside our index.js file we are calling the root div and creating a root using .createRoot() function. That is why the page content is visible on the html page

index.html code:
     <div id="root"></div>

index.js code: 
    // creating Root on root div
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

    // rendering root variable and inside we render <App /> component
    root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
    </React.StrictMode>
    );
