The best practice is to put new compoenents to new file so you have 1 component per file
Components should nest inside app.js or other parent Components. Ultimatly with react we build a component tree. You have a main parent component called app and inside that app you have other custom HTML components which hold other pieces of the user interface.

Bigger apps can have a larger component tree inside of which app component is directly rendered into single page HTML page. 


Naming convention of components:
we should use "Pascal Case" when naming react components that means first letter should be uppercase example: ExpenseItem.

We use this convention because react considers lowercased HTML tag names as standard HTML syntax and renderes it like normal HTML, whereas Pascal cased tags are considered as custom react components

A COMPONENT IN REACT IS JUST A JS FUNCTION. IT IS A SPECIAL KIND OF FUNCTION REGARDING WHAT IT RETURNS (JSX CODE)
