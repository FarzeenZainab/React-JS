What is react?
React is a JS library for building user interfaces

HTML, CSS and JS are about building user interfaces as well
React makes building complex and reactive user interfaces simpler. We donot need react, we can any website using HTML CSS and JS. But if you have complex user interfaces you should use react to build them quickly and highly interactive.

To make the development process simpler, react uses a concept called "components".

What is a component?
Components are reusable blocks that we can use to reduce repetition in our code.
It is a combination of HTML code, CSS code and JS for some logic 

Why use components?

1. Reusablity
    To remove repetition and write clean code

2. Separation of concerns
    To separate each part of a page in different components, don't do too many things one and the same place. Divide one large html page that contains tons of logics and styling for one user interface is hard to manage instead divide it into small managable chunks and each chunk is reponsible for doing one simple task
    
    Take it as, we have functions in programming to do a particular task repeatdly. Same thing
    react is doing for us in the frontend world.
