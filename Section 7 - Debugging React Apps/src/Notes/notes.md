### Analyzing Code Flow and Warning

- if their are no compilation error and not error in the console but the application is not giving expected outcome then there is something wrong with the code.

- We have to analyze our code and fix the bug

### Looking the terminal and console for errors

- if there is any technical issue in the project the terminal will highlight the issue.

- Console will also show us the error when there is any bug encountered.

### using debugger breakpoints

- if you are not looking at console or terminal error, there is another way to debug the issue by using chrome's debugger tool

- you can add breakpoints and analyze line to line execution of the code in the browser. On the breakpoint you can see the variables we can access, the callstack and so on.

### using ReactDev Tools

- install chrome extension for reactDev tools
- after adding this there are two new tabs added to the devtools
- components and profiler
